Now days cyber criminals are increasingly using automated SQL injection attacks powered by botnets to hit vulnerable systems. SQL injection attacks is the prevalent way of attacking front-end Web applications and back-end databases to compromise data confidentiality. Recently published reports by the Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) shows SQL injections as the top attack vector, making up 19 percent of all security breaches examined by WHID.  Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 risk categorization chart, rates SQL injection risk as number one threat along with operating system command injection and LDAP injection attack.

## Why SQL injection attacks still exist ##

But why does this happen? Have you ever thought about it? Well the answer is easy, we're seeing such an increase in SQL injection incidents because we have an "industrialization of hacking". SQL injection attacks are generally carried out by typing malformed "SQL commands into front-end Web application input boxes" that are tied to database accounts in order to trick the database into offering more access to information than the developer intended.

## Why badly implemented SQL injection filters exist ##

SQL injection attacks happen because of badly implemented Web Application filters, meaning that the web application will often fail to properly sanitize malicious user input.  You can usually find this type of badly implemented SQL injection filters in outsourced web applications to India, Asia or other possibly third world countries, that developers are not aware of what SQL injection proper filtering is. Most of the time well known large organizations from the financial sector will create a large team of functional and security testers and then outsource the project in order to reduce the development cost, at the same time they would try to maintain and increase the control of the web application development progress and quality assurance process.
