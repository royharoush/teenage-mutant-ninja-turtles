Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles project aggregates known attack patterns, predictable resource names, server response error messages, and other resources like web directory paths into the most comprehensive Open Source database of malicious and malformed input test cases.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles project is four things:

  1. A Web Application payload database.
  1. A Web Application error database.
  1. A Web Application payload mutator.
  1. A Web Application payload manager.

Nowadays all high profile sites found in financial and telecommunication sector use filters to filter out all types of vulnerabilities such as SQL, XSS, XXE, Http Header Injection e.t.c. In this particular project I am going to provide you with a tool to generate Obfuscated Fuzz strings in order to bypass badly implemented Web Application injection filters (e.t.c SQL, XSS and Path-traversal Injections e.t.c). Also with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you will be able to do payload management by generating custom payload lists to test thoroughly your Web Application for all type of vulnerabilities such path traversal and  SQL obfuscated payloads.
